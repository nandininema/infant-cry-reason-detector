# Infant-cry-reason-detector
predicting reason  of infant's cry (like sad, hungry,lonely,discomfort etc) using svm model in R.

## Dataset :
https://github.com/gveres/donateacry-corpus

                
12 coefficents of mfcc  feature from wav file  have been extracted  which are for training and testing datatset.
Columnsâ€œmean1","mean12"," "," " ,"sd1","sd12"are used for implementing feature of predicting accurate class . 

Model has been trained for predicting the class using Linear Support Vector Machine,Polynomial  Support Vector Machine, Radial Support Vector Machine and Sigmoid Support Vector Machine.
